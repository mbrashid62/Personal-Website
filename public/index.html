                            <h2>Temperature Reader</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <p>This was an academic team project for my Senior Design class. Overall this project was challenging but my group and I worked very well together and were successful in accomplishing it.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project consisted of three distinct components. An Arduino circuit board for reading temperature from a sensor, a Java program for collecting serialized data from the board, and a web application for displaying the temperature readings in real-time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The latter two components was what I worked on.
                                This involved importing the Java RXTX library to handle I/O from the Arduino and programming Java Swing components to perform the desired operations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the web interface, I used jQuery to parse the incoming data stream from plaintext to JSON format.
                                This enabled me to use Morris (a Javascript chart library) to visualize the data in real-time by refreshing the
                                data every second.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the end it was a very cool feeling see all the components of the lab work together. We could dip the temperature sensor in
                                ice water and watch the chart fall and begin breathing on it and see the chart rise up again!
                            </p>

                                    As an intern, my duties included implementing and improving online editing features using Backbone and Node.

                                <p>
                                    I worked on a mix of front-end and back-end features such as, responding to various UI events, optimizing content upload, and handling app data from Kibana (an analytics tool).
                                </p>

                                    I was also responsible for integrating responsiveness, simplifying styling, and promoting extensibility using the CSS libraries LESS and SASS.

                                    Working on ProofMe was my first time working on a professional-grade project.
                                    My time with Meta helped shape my professional aspirations by inspiring me
                                    to learn more about Web Applications - specifically SAAS projects.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of my side projects have involved primarily front-end code. I wanted to build something
                                with back-end functionality because I believe all web developers (even front-end ones) should have some skill with back-end code.
                            </p>

                            <p>I taught myself Angular and Firebase, two google products with steep learning curves, but tremendous potential when the light bulb clicks.</p>
                            <p>
                                In my app, I used Firebase to assist me with handling user login and registration.
                                Firebase also grants me to ability to allow users to save sounds they like to a NoSQL database -- which consequently, allows users to view their sounds later.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the front-end, I followed an MVC pattern using Angular. By following several tutorials and practicing on my own,
                                I was able to design front-end that I believe is pretty scalable and robust.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The main goal of this side project was to familiarize myself with new front-end and back-end technologies.
                                By doing so I became a more well-rounded developer.
                                What was interesting from this project was that learning Angular from a React background helped me understand the nuances of both frameworks at a deeper level.
                                Likewise, learning how a NoSQL data structure works compared to a traditional MySQL data structure helped me understand
                                the different ways app store data from a new perspective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I grow as an engineer, I will be continuing to work on side projects because I believe they
                                are the best way to learn new skills.

                            <p>Sprout Social is a Chicago tech startup that specializes in social media management software. The Sprout platform
                                serves over 16,000 clients across the globe and is growing rapidly.
                            </p>
                            <p>As a front-end engineering intern, my responsibilities involved building new features with React and Redux as well
                                optimizing existing features in Backbone.
                            </p>
                            <p>The feature I primarily worked on was an Asset Library for Sprout's enterprise customers.
                            This feature allows users to upload digital content to their Sprout accounts and integrate this content seamlessly into
                            other parts of the app.</p>

                            <p>I accomplished several user stories for this feature. These include but are not limited to
                                switching between grid and list views, sorting assets, filtering assets, selecting assets, and viewing asset details.</p>

                            <p>In addition, I spent a lot of time thoroughly testing my code.
                                My team at Sprout considered writing unit tests as well integration tests one of the developer's core responsibilities. This
                            helped me get comfortable with modern testing techniques and form the habit of testing my own code outside of Sprout.</p>

                            <p>
                                My experience at Sprout allowed me to grow tremendously as a developer by learning from very talented people
                                and working in a professional environment. Surely it will be one I will never forget!

                            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Platin_Drums_PTCL2016_AF.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
                                For my final project for my Embedded Systems class, I created a 4 piece electric drum set.
                                This project involved both a hardware and a software component.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using an arduino as my microcontroller, I designed a circuit that transmits MIDI data to my computer when a user taps a drum pad (tupperware container).
                                The drum pads are triggered by four individual piezo sensors (sensors that detect vibration) attached beneath the lid of each container. One for bass, snare, hi-hat, and tom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My arduino code initializes a MIDI connection to my computer and transmits the appropriate MIDI bytes. As MIDI bytes are read, the corresponding
                                MIDI note is sent to my comptuer's MIDI channel, triggering an output as if the user was playing any off-the-shelf MIDI instrument.
                                The result can be heard through any software that outputs MIDI notes (Garageband, Logic, Abelton, etc).
                            </p>
                            <p>The inspiration for this project came from my difficulty finding a drummer to jam with as a guitar player.
                                Unlike guitars, drums are expensive, loud, and difficult to move around.
                                I wanted to build a portable system my friends and I can use to play easy, simple drum beats with to our guitars.</p>
                            <p>This project was a great way to apply what I learned about embedded systems in a practical and fun way!</p>

                            <p>
                                This chat app utilizes the Socialist Millionaire Protocol to verify the identity of two end users through the use of a common, shared secret.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The project works by encrypting each users' public and private keys as well as their shared secret (which they are prompted to enter right away).
                                By performing a series of complex math sequences, the app can then verify if the user is indeed who they say they are, allowing users to exchange encrypted messages safely!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When using this app, it is helpful to have a console window open to see the exchange of fmessages betwen client and server. The OTR module I used makes all this data available
                                to the client - this includes the authentication process as well as the message exchanges.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Please be patient while waiting for authentication, it may take several minutes for the SMP algorithm to complete.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My inspiration for this app came from wanting to solidify my understanding of the client server relationship in web applications.
                                I believe at a fundamental level, chat apps are a great way to do this. In addition, I discovered a lot of interesting and useful
                                information while reading about encryption and message security.
